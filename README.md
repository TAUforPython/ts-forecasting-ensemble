# Build Time Series Forecasting Ensembles


- `ETS, TBATS` and `AUTO.ARIMA` (Using `R` through `rpy2`)
- `ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX` (Using `statsmodels`)
- `Prophet` (using Facebook's Python Library)
- `tsfresh` from Blue Yonder for automated feature extraction from time-series data.
- add `chronos` autogluon timeseries model prediction like a language model

# Forecasting tl;dr

These are the steps

- **Explore**
    - Plot the data
    - Clean outliers, Impute missing values if needed

- **Transform**
    - Take the natural log if needed

- **Decompose**
    - Check if the time-series has any **overall trend** or **seasonality**
    - Plot the decomposed series

- **Check for Stationarity** and find $d$
    - Is the series stationary?
    - Run the Augmented Dickey Fuller test,
    - Check ACF & PACF plots to
    - Determine **order of differencing** needed to stationarize the series

- **Check for Autocorrelations** and find $p, q$
    - Examine ACF and PACF plots

- **Fit ARIMA/SARIMAX model over a grid**
    - Use (p, d, q) and set up a grid search
    - Find the best model using
        - AIC/BIC
        - Out of Sample Prediction Error
    - Check your Residuals, they should be ~$N(0, 1)$ and look like white noise

- **Make predictions**

PS: that ARIMA models assume non-seasonal series, so you'll need to de-seasonalize the series before modeling
